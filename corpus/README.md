This corpus consists of 31 .txt files downloaded from [this Project Gutenberg page](http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/author?name=Allen%2C%20Grant%2C%201848-1899) compiled by [the Online Books Page and John Mark Ockerbloom](http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/). I chose the Gutenberg files for their availability and accurate transcriptions. I chose only single-author books and did not include travel guides.

The corpus is organized into three different folders: ["raw"](raw) (the state they were when downloaded), [“stripped”](stripped)(devoid of paratextual material), and [“oneString”](onestring) (rewritten into one long sequence of characters without line breaks or carriage returns). See ["Code"](../#code-1) for more information on how the files and folders relate to each other or their context of use.
